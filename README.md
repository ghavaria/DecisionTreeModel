# DecisionTreeModel

##### predicting Income of a given population

In this lab, we will build a decision tree to predict the income of a given population, which is labelled as <= 50𝐾𝑎𝑛𝑑> 50K. The attributes (predictors) are age, working class type, marital status, gender, race etc.

In the following sections, we'll:

- clean and prepare the data,
- build a decision tree with default hyperparameters,
- understand all the hyperparameters that we can tune, and finally
- choose the optimal hyperparameters using grid search cross-validation.
